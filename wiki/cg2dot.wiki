$ ./cg2dot.py --help
Usage: cg2dot.py [options] file [file ...]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t THRESHOLD, --threshold=THRESHOLD
                        remove fast tails that took less then this percent of
                        total execution time. Default is 1%.
  -a MODE, --aggregate=MODE
                        aggregation mode. Can have values "none" and "func-
                        file". The "none" means that aggregation will be
                        completely off. This is usually very memory wasting,
                        so use it very carefully especially with the xdot. The
                        "func-file" mode means that each call will be keyed by
                        (mapped to) file and function names of every call from
                        it's stack. Then all calls will be aggregated
                        (reduced) according to these keys. Default is "func-
                        file".

==Performance==
cg2dot processes (lexer + tree builder + tree aggregator + dot generator) about 1.6mb of raw cg per second on Coreâ„¢2 Duo P7350 2.0GHz.
Lexer takes about half of this time.
